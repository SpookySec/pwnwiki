## 🧭 What to Learn Next

You now know about basic buffer overflows — here are the next logical steps:

- 🛡️ **Learn Binary Protections & How to Evade Them**  
  Understand mitigations like `NX`, `ASLR`, `Stack Canaries`, `PIE`, `RELRO`, and how to bypass or defeat them.

- 🔁 **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)**  
  Learn how to chain gadgets together when you can’t inject shellcode.

- 🔢 **Format String Vulnerabilities**  
  Exploit `printf()` and similar functions to leak or write memory.

- 🐚 **Shellcoding & Assembly**  
  Write your own shellcode, understand syscall conventions.

!!! tip "Pro Tip 💡"
	The best way to get better is to read writeups, recreate them, and eventually start writing your own.

Keep pushing — you've just scratched the surface.
