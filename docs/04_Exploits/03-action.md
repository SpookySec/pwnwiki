# 🎯 The Action

You've built the exploit... now let’s **see it in action**.

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. 💥 Crash

Let’s run the binary in `gdb` to **verify** our control over the return address.

```bash
$ gdb ./exploitme
gef➤ start
gef➤ pattern create 100
```

### 2. 🔍 Inspect
Paste that pattern into the binary’s input and crash it. Then:

```bash
gef➤ info registers
gef➤ pattern offset [value of RIP]
```

🔍 This gives you the exact **offset** to control the instruction pointer.

### 3. 🚀 Launch the Final Exploit

Now let’s run the Python script from earlier:

```bash
$ python3 exploit.py
```

If everything is correct, you’ll see:

```
win() called!
Here's your flag: flag{dummy_flag}
```

Boom 💥 You’ve hijacked execution and landed in `win()`!

## 🛠️ Debugging Tips

- Use `hexdump(payload)` to inspect payload contents.
- Use `gdb.attach(p)` in the script for live debugging:

```python
p = elf.process()
gdb.attach(p)
```

This lets you hit **breakpoints** and inspect **memory/registers** during the attack.

---

## ✅ Recap

- You found a buffer overflow.
- Calculated the offset to RIP.
- Redirected control to the `win()` function.
- Got the flag. 🎉

Now you're thinking like an exploiter. 🧠💀
