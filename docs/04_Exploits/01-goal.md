# 🧨 The Goal

---

## 🔍 The Setup

We have a binary named `exploitme`. Inside it:

- There’s a function called `win()`.
- It **contains the flag** we want.
- But it’s **never called** in the program’s normal execution.

---

## 🧠 The Goal

Call the `win()` function by exploiting the program.

---

## 🔎 `main()`

It really doesn't get simpler than this:

![](main().png)

No signs of `win()` being called directly... Suspicious, right?

But wait — something interesting pops up:

> The program allocates a buffer of 32 bytes:

```c
char local_28[32];
```

Then proceeds to read **64 bytes** of input.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

So no, `win()` isn’t called anywhere in the code...

**But we’re going to make it happen.**

By spotting the bug in the code, we can make it do whatever want.
