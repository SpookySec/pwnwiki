## üîç ELF File: Top to Bottom

ELF files have a well-defined structure, which lets the OS load and run programs correctly. To analyze or exploit binaries, it helps to understand this layout step-by-step ‚Äî just like opening a file and inspecting its parts.

---

### 1. ELF Header (File's "Table of Contents")

The ELF header is at the very top of the file. It tells us:

- What kind of file it is (executable, shared object, etc.)
- The target architecture (e.g., x86_64)
- The entry point address (where execution begins)
- Where to find the program headers and section headers in the file

You can see this info with:

```
$ readelf -h /bin/ls       
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
  Class:                             ELF64
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              DYN (Position-Independent Executable file)
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x6aa0
  Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          136232 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               64 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         13
  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         31
  Section header string table index: 30
```

### 2. Program Headers (Memory Mapping Instructions)

Program headers describe how the file should be loaded into memory. They specify which parts of the file become segments in memory, and their permissions (read, write, execute).

For exploitation, these tell us:

- Where the code segment (`.text`) is loaded
- Where data segments (`.data`, `.bss`) go
- Stack and heap locations aren‚Äôt here but are managed at runtime

Inspect with:

```bash
$ readelf -l /bin/ls

Elf file type is DYN (Position-Independent Executable file)
Entry point 0x6aa0
There are 13 program headers, starting at offset 64

Program Headers:
  Type           Offset             VirtAddr           PhysAddr
                 FileSiz            MemSiz              Flags  Align

...
```

| Flag | Meaning                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| `R`  | Readable                     |
| `W`  | Writable                     |
| `E`  | Executable                   |
| `A`  | Allocated (loaded in memory) |

### 3. Section Headers (File Organization)

Sections are like pieces inside the file used during linking and debugging. Key sections include:

- `.text` ‚Äî contains executable instructions
- `.data` / `.bss` ‚Äî global/static initialized and uninitialized variables
- `.rodata` ‚Äî read-only data like strings
- `.plt/.got` ‚Äî jump tables for dynamic linking (important for exploits)

Sections organize the file‚Äôs content but aren‚Äôt always loaded contiguously in memory.

Check with:

```
readelf -S /bin/ls       
There are 31 section headers, starting at offset 0x21428:

Section Headers:
  [Nr] Name              Type             Address           Offset

### 4. In-Memory Layout (What Really Matters)

When the program runs, the loader maps these segments into memory:

- The code lives in an executable segment (from `.text`)
- The data lives in writable segments (`.data`, `.bss`)
- The stack is set up for local variables and function calls
-  The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, etc.)

Your goal as an exploiter is to understand how user input flows into memory regions and how those affect program control flow.

## üîë Summary

- The ELF header points to program and section headers
-  Program headers describe memory layout
- Sections organize the file‚Äôs contents
- Understanding this layout helps you trace where code and data live, which is crucial for exploitation

!!! question "Overwhelmed?"
	I was too, and still am. Give it time and it'll become natural.
